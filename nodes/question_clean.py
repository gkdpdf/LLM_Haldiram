    # Create validation prompt to check if query is database-related
    validation_prompt = f"""
Analyze the following user query to determine if it's a valid database query that can be answered with SQL:

User Query: "{user_query}"

Consider:
1. Does it ask for data retrieval, filtering, or analysis?
2. Does it mention entities that could be database tables/columns?
3. Is it asking for counts, sums, averages, or other aggregations?
4. Does it request specific records or filtered results?

Examples of VALID queries:
- "Show me all customers from New York"
- "What's the total sales for last month?"
- "List employees with salary > 50000"
- "How many orders were placed today?"

Examples of INVALID queries:
- "What's the weather today?"
- "Tell me a joke"
- "How do I cook pasta?"
- "What's 2+2?"

Respond with:
- "VALID" if it's a database query
- "INVALID" if it's not a database query
